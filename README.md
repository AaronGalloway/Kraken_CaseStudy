# Kraken Case Study
### Prepared by: Aaron Galloway

## Overview and Origin

**Name:** 
Kraken (crunchbase.com/organization/kraken)

**Incorporation Date:**
July 28, 2011 (crunchbase.com/organization/kraken)

**Launch Date:** 
September 2013

**Founder/s:**
Jesse Powell (crunchbase.com/organization/kraken)

**How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?:** 
Kraken was born out of the Mt. Gox exchange attack. Jesse Powell came in to Mt. Gox as somewhat of a "fixer" for Mt. Gox after their initial breach and decided to start Kraken as a replacement in the event Mt. Gox went away, which it did. (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-17/mt-gox-insider-s-kraken-exchange-to-open-in-japan-next-month)

**How is the company funded? How much funding have they received:** 
Kraken has been equity funded. So far there has been a Series A (2014), B (2016), and C (2019) with an additional Equity Crowdfunding round in 2019. Total Funding raised has been 118.5m (crunchbase.com/organization/kraken)


## Business Activities:

**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**
The Kraken website specifically states that, "Our mission is to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrency so that you and the rest of the world can achieve financial freedom and inclusion." (https://www.kraken.com/en-us/why-kraken)

Kraken is a cryptocurrency exchange that prides itself on security, liquidity and customer support. The company was borne out of a major security breach at the major exchange of the time (Mt. Gox). Experienced and novice customers in the crypto space have a need for a secure platform that allows for liquidity/speed in transaction. Kraken aims to solve this need while simultaneously increasing the community of crypto users.

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**
The listed mission of the company does not state a specific desired user. The mission is to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrency. We can reason that cryptocurency is an alternative or replacement to fiat currency. We can also reason that almost everyone in the world uses, or is impacted, by fiat currency. I will not go as far to make one of the investor pitch statements of death, "The target market it everyone." What I will say is the target is broad, and Kraken is most likely in the Early Adopters phase of customer growth even after being around for 9 years. 

Looking at a normal distribution curve the Early Adopters are the appx. 13.6% that fall between -1 and -2 from the mean. What that means is there is still a large opportunity for growth in cryptocurrency, and specifically for Kraken.

Kraken does not publicly report to the IRS or publicly report total account numbers so there is not hard data around users.

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**
There isn't one particular unfair advantage that Kraken has over everyone else. This is true for most companies that have reached a certain size and are of a certain age. The idea of an unfair advantage is one that exists primarily in textbooks and in conversations with investors who aren't actually going to invest in your business. Kraken had an early mover advantage (they were not the first), and has so far avoided major scandals and hacking. 

There was a smaller breach recently (https://news.bitcoin.com/kraken-targeted-hackers-accounts-compromised/) but the breach was for less than three hundred dollars in equivalent crypto. Kraken was also the target of a DDoS attack which led to a still-unresolved class action lawsuit. Even with the issues listed previously Kraken's commitment to security is evident through their dedicated security lab which focuses on the safety of crypto wallets and other products (https://blog.kraken.com/security-labs/).

They are not the only exchange. They are not the only place offering liquidity. They are not the only crypto company focused on security and trying to increase engagement. I would argue this is not a problem. The market is large enough to handle multiple financial players. There are multiple exchanges for legacy companies and fiat currencies, why can't there be more than one cryptocurrency exchange?

**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)**
Kraken is using React JavaScript library, Bootstrap HTML and CSS library, and Cloudflare for performance and security. (https://stackshare.io/kraken/kraken)


## Landscape:

**What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**
Blockchain and Cryptocurrency

**What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**
Existence. Cryptocurrency as we know it began in 2009. This is a very new field. From a societal standpoint it is well along on the standard acceptance path. 
1. It was a weird fringe thing that only those who knew to look for could find.
2. Those in tangential industries (computer, banking, etc.) became aware of it but did not take it seriously.
3. Popularity started to gain and legal entities and regulators started to take notice, but moved relatively slow or not at all (especially in the US) when it came to acceptance and regulation.
4. The general population caught wind of it and created a boom in late 2017.
5. Apps like Cash App and Coinbase have made buying/selling cryptocurrencies easier than ever, thus opening up more opportunities to casual users.

Blockchains have followed a similar trajectory with more people now understanding the difference between a blockchain and a cryptocurrency. The usefulness and power of blockchain technology is just now beginning to be explored. Recently the USDA spoke about blockchains in agriculture (https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-government-believes-blockchains-will-play-essential-role-in-agriculture-2020-08-18).

**What are the other major companies in this domain?**
Coinbase, Gemeni, Binance, Huobi Global, HBTC, Bidesk


## Results

**What has been the business impact of this company so far?**
As one of the five oldest exchanges (https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) still operating the impact of Kraken cannot be understated to the cryptocurrency community. Kraken has remained a constant through the different levels of acceptance and as cryptocurrency has evolved to be what we know today. The mission of the company is increasing adoption of cryptocurrency and it is following through on that.

**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**
Internal metrics would be Daily Average Trades (DAT) and Users (Total Users, Daily Active Users, etc.). Unfortunately those are not readily available externally. External metrics would be Daily Volume and as of 9/15/2020 at 10 PM ET Kraken had a rolling 24h volume of 3,573,072,719 which is more than solid.

**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**
Based on volume on 9/15/2020 for the rolling 24h period Kraken was the number 8 exchange in the world (https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/)

## Recommendations

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**
I would not recommend adding anything new. This is not because I'm uninspired or not creative, but rather recognize that the market is already out there and can support multiple players. The key isn't a new feature. They key to adoption is removing fear and increasing understanding of potential customers to the point where they feel comfortable using Kraken. 

The average American resident has close to nothing (or nothing) saved, and 45% of Americans don't own stock (https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx). If people won't invest in legacy items that are constantly promoted in society, a new feature on your crypto site won't make much of a difference. 

For that reason I would recommend increasing education and awareness efforts of Kraken instead of new feature development.

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
Increasing educational efforts and branding Kraken as the point of knowledge for all things cryptocurrency to the average consumner gains invaluable mindshare of the market. When people think crypto, or have a question related to crypto, they would to Kraken. This also serves the dual purpose of creating the most powerful type of marketing which are advocates. Humans, by nature, love to be the point of knowledge. If Kraken empowers an individual with a level of knowledge about crypto they did not have, the person who was empowered will more than likely share with their friends/family the great news that is Kraken.

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**
Leveraging the stack of React, Cloudflare, and Bootstrap along with Vimeo or another video service would make sense as a start. The more important aspect of this strategy is which channels are used. The type of marketing that is done is going to make a huge difference. 

I would recommend a 360 degree approach where native assets were created, some promoted and others evergreen. Targeted partnerships and promotions would increase upper level/funnel awareness and drive people to the website. Once on the website the key would be making people click and stick. The good news is React and Bootstrap are both known for quality mobile-responsive websites.

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**
The key to education is simplicity. The information is what should make people think, not the design or navigation of the site. The content has to shine and everything else must get out of the way. Using the tools listed above allows for the completion of that goal.
